4. During signup, razorpay will ask your PAN and Bank account details, after filling these details, you will reach razorpay Dashboard.
5. On the left-hand side menu, you will see the option "API & Plugins" click on this button.
6. This plugin is based on razorpay API v2.0, So it will not work with API Key and Auth Token. For this plugin to work, you will have to generate Client ID and Client Secret. On the bottom of "API & Plugins" page, you will see Generate Credentials / Create new Credentials button. Click on this button.
7. Now you will have to choose a platform from the drop-down menu. You can choose any of them, but I will recommend choosing option "WooCommerce/WordPress"
8. Copy "Client ID" & "Client Secret" and paste it in the Charitable razorpay extension (Live Client ID and Live Client Secrect respectively)
9. Save the settings and its done.
